# ETC Eos Remote

A third-party remote control app for ETC Eos family consoles.

## Installation

Download the [latest release](https://github.com/CoffeeCoder1/etc-eos-remote/releases/latest).

## Support

If you run into any issues, please submit an issue on the [issues tab](https://github.com/CoffeeCoder1/etc-eos-remote/issues) on this repo. This software is still in pretty early development, so it hasn't been very thoroughly tested, and I can't fix issues I don't know about.

## Protocol

This app controls the console over OSC, as is documented in the [Eos Family User Manual](https://www.etcconnect.com/WebDocs/Controls/EosFamilyOnlineHelp/en-us/Default.htm#32_Show_Control/08_Open_Sound_Control_(OSC)/Using_OSC.htm?TocPath=Show%2520Control%257COpen%2520Sound%2520Control%2520(OSC)%2520%257C_____1).
